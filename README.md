# ML Test Score Performance Analysis


## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of machine learning test scores across multiple batches. The objective is to evaluate performance trends, identify consistency levels, and derive meaningful insights that support data-driven academic decision-making.

The analysis follows a real-world exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow, similar to performance evaluation scenarios in educational and training environments.

## Problem Statement

Given student test scores (out of 7) from three different batches:

Analyze batch-wise performance

Compare score distributions

Evaluate variability and consistency

Identify strengths and improvement areas

This is an open-ended analytical task focused on interpretation and insight generation.

## Dataset Description

Batch – Represents the batch name

User_ID – Unique identifier for each student

Score – Test score ranging from 0 to 7

Each record corresponds to an individual student’s test performance.

## Methodology

The following steps were performed:

Data validation and quality assessment

Batch-wise descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)

Distribution analysis using histograms and boxplots

Comparative batch performance evaluation

Performance segmentation (Low, Medium, High)

## Key Insights

Distinct performance patterns were observed across batches

One batch showed higher average scores and strong consistency

Another batch displayed moderate performance with higher variability

A batch with lower scores indicated the need for focused academic support

Greater consistency was associated with improved overall performance

## Business & Academic Impact

Enables targeted mentoring and intervention strategies

Supports data-driven evaluation of training effectiveness

Helps identify high-performing students for advanced learning paths

Provides a scalable framework for academic performance analysis

## Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can effectively evaluate student performance, uncover meaningful trends, and support informed decision-making in academic and training programs.
